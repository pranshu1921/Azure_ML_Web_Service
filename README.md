## General info

Although web services can be created directly within Azure ML Studio, in some cases it may be more straightforward to develop and deploy a web service entirely within a Python notebook. Python notebooks allow rapid prototyping and allow developers to include commentary in Markdown. This tutorial demonstrates how the azureml package can be used to deploy Azure ML web services directly from within a Python notebook (or other Python environment).

Note: the azureml package presently works only with Python 2; be sure to set the notebook's kernel appropriately.

Access your data in Azure Notebooks
Data is the lifeblood of notebooks. Jupyter itself provides only a runtime environment for a notebook, and thus to do intresting work you need to bring data in from elsewhere.

This notebook provides examples of different ways to import data, all in a format that you can run and experience directly.

## Setup

* Download the Jupyter Notebooks above on your computer.
* Run the jupyter notebooks

## Status
Project is: Finished

## Inspiration
This project was part of the learning process for exploration of Microsoft Azure ML Studio for academic requirements.
